Despite a brilliant performance from Tyler Lockett, the Cardinals' defense forced three interceptions, including one from rookie Isaiah Simmons with under a minute remaining in overtime. Ten Cardinals points in the final 2:28 sent the game to OT, where kicker Zane Gonzalez atoned for his first OT field goal miss, drilling the game-winning 48-yard field goal to hand Seattle its first loss on the season";
