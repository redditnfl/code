$sidebarText: "The Dallas Cowboys and QB Dak Prescott agreed to a new contract on Monday, ending the long-standing dispute between the two parties. The four-year, $160M contract features the second-highest guaranteed money figure in NFL history, while the $75M due in 2021 will be the highest single-season total of all time. The contract's no-tag clause and relatively short length will allow Prescott to test the free agency market at the age of 31, potentially setting him up for an even bigger contract in the future.";
