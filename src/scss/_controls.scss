The Green Bay Packers will welcome the Los Angeles Rams to frigid Lambeau Field, while the high-octane Kansas City Chiefs will square off against the ground-and-pound Cleveland Browns. This weekend may also feature the final Brady/Brees battle, their squads facing off for a third time this season. Finally, two much-scrutinized 2017 draft picks will battle when the Buffalo Bills take on the Baltimore Ravens.";
