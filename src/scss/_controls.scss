The prolific defensive end played 15 seasons in the NFL, including 10 with the Vikings. Minnesota drafted Doleman fourth overall out of Pittsburgh in the 1985 draft and the edge rusher made an instant impact, earning All-Rookie honors. A member of the Vikings Ring of Honor, Doleman was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012.";
