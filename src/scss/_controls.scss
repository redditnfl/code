$sidebarText: "After another exciting weekend of football, the Championship game participants have been decided. The Packers offense was too much for the #1 ranked Rams defense, resulting in the Packers returning to the NFCC for the second year in a row. The Tampa Bay defense also showed up big, forcing 4 turnover, including 3 interceptions, in what might be Drew Brees' last game. Buffalo handled the Ravens 1st ranked run game and a late 3rd quarter 101 yard interception return for a TD sealed the game. In a game that saw Patrick Mahomes suffer a concussion and leave the game midway through the 3rd quarter, the Browns defense held the Chiefs to only 2 TDs and 22 total points in a losing effort.";
