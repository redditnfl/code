$sidebarText: "Over the weekend, the offseason QB carousel took its first spin. In a move reminiscent of the Brock Osweiler trade, the Detroit Lions sent 12-year veteran Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for two-time Pro Bowler Jared Goff and three draft picks (including two firsts). Stafford gives the Rams stability at the quarterback position, while Goff could either cement himself as Detroit's long-term starter or serve as an effective bridge QB. In this first-ever swap of #1 overall picks, LA's front office hopes that this is the move that pushes them over the top.";
