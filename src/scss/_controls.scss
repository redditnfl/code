$sidebarText: "A veteran personnel man, Thompson spent all but five of his 26 active years in NFL front offices with the Packers. He was a two-time Super Bowl champion in Titletown, earning a ring as director of pro personnel in the 1996 season and as general manager 14 years later. As Packers GM, Thompson was responsible for hiring Mike McCarthy as head coach and drafting fixtures of Green Bay's Super Bowl-winning team in 2010 and beyond. He drafted 16 players who went on to make at least one Pro Bowl while with the Packers. Green Bay compiled a 125-82-1 record and tallied nine playoff appearances over Thompson's 13 seasons as general manager.";
