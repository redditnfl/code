$sidebarText: "After another exciting weekend of football, the Championship game participants have been decided. The Packers offense was too much for the #1 ranked Rams defense, allowing the Packers to advance to their second NFCC game in a row. The Tampa Bay defense also showed up big, forcing 4 turnovers, including 3 interceptions, in what might be Drew Brees' last game. Buffalo handled the Ravens' 1st ranked run game and a late 3rd quarter 101 yard interception return for a TD sealed the game. Despite being held to only 22 points by a stout Browns defense, and losing Mahomes to a concussion in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs held off a late rally to win.";
