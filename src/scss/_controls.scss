$sidebarText: "Known best for his Martyball philosophy, focused on team toughness and establishing the rushing attack, Schottenheimer stood at the helm for four NFL franchises, establishing a winning culture everywhere he went. His coaching tenures were marked with consistent success, with winning records in his time with Cleveland, Kansas City and San Diego, and an 8-8 season in Washington. Marty was a football lifer, starting with a six-year career as a linebacker for the Bills and Patriots in the ‘60s. Shortly after his retirement, he worked his way up the coaching ladder to spending 21 seasons calling the shots. Schottenheimer’s 200 career regular season wins ranks 7th all time among head coaches, ahead of Hall of Famers Chuck Noll, Bill Parcells and Paul Brown. Schottenheimer is survived by his wife, two children and four grandchildren. Rest in Peace, Coach.";
