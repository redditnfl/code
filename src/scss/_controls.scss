The first round of the playoffs will feature a tripleheader on both Saturday and Sunday, owing to the addition of a 7th seed in each conference. In another first, Nickelodeon will simulcast Sunday's Bears/Saints affair, with slime in the endzone and on-field graphics geared towards children. Though a new year brings many possibilities, one thing is certain - a new Super Bowl champion will be crowned on February 7th.";
