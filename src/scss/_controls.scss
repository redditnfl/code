$sidebarText: "Longtime NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer has passed away at the age of 77. He was known best for his 'Martyball' philosophy, which focused on team toughness and establishing the rushing attack. His coaching tenures were marked by consistent winning records in Cleveland, Kansas City and San Diego. Marty was a football lifer, enjoying a six-year career as a linebacker for the Bills and Patriots in the ‘60s. Shortly after retirement, he climbed the coaching ladder before spending 21 seasons as a head coach. Schottenheimer’s 200 career regular season wins rank 7th all-time among head coaches and he was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2010.";
