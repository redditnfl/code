$sidebarText: "With the dust from Sunday afternoon settled, the stage is set for Super Bowl LV. After a one-year hiatus, Tom Brady makes his return to the big game, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers knocked off the Green Bay Packers in chilly Lambeau Field 31-26 (with some assistance from Matt LaFleur). Meanwhile, Kansas City appears dominant as ever, as Patrick Mahomes' three touchdown passes through turf toe lifted them over the Buffalo Bills, 38-24. These teams met before in late November - expect a similarly close game as old guard meets young phenom once again, this time with the Lombardi Trophy on the line.";
