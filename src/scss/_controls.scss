First, the wild card Tampa Bay Buccaneers (led by perennial playoff participant Tom Brady) roll in to Lambeau to take on the Green Bay Packers and the presumptive MVP, Aaron Rodgers. Then, the upstart Buffalo Bills travel west to face the offensive juggernaut Kansas City Chiefs - though superstar QB Patrick Mahomes' status remains unclear. With no Pro Bowl, only three NFL games remain in this unlikely season. Nevertheless, all four of these teams are hoping to represent their conference in Tampa on February 7th for a chance at sports immortality.";
