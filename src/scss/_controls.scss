$sidebarText: "The NFL's first Super Wild Card Weekend did not disappoint, with three teams notching their first playoff wins in years. The Cleveland Browns (last playoff win: 1994) knocked off their archrival Pittsburgh Steelers 48-37, though a date with the Chiefs looms next week. With fans in the stands, the Buffalo Bills (1995) defeated the stingy Indianapolis Colts in a 27-24 thriller. Finally, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2002) survived a career game from Taylor Heinicke, winning 31-23 over Washington. All three squads have tough opponents next week as their fans hope to keep these dream seasons alive.";
